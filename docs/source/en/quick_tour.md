# Quick Tour

## Set up

The easiest way to get started with TEI is to use one of the official Docker containers
(see [Supported models and hardware](supported_models) to choose the right container).

Hence one needs to install Docker following their [installation instructions](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

TEI supports inference both on GPU and CPU. If you plan on using a GPU, make sure to check that your hardware is supported by checking [this table](https://github.com/huggingface/text-embeddings-inference?tab=readme-ov-file#docker-images).
Next, install the [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html). NVIDIA drivers on your device need to be compatible with CUDA version 12.2 or higher.

## Deploy

Next it's time to deploy your model. Let's say you want to use [`BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5`](https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5). Here's how you can do this:

```shell
model=BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5
volume=$PWD/data

docker run --gpus all -p 8080:80 -v $volume:/data --pull always ghcr.io/huggingface/text-embeddings-inference:1.7 --model-id $model
```

<Tip>

We also recommend sharing a volume with the Docker container (`volume=$PWD/data`) to avoid downloading weights every run.

</Tip>

## Inference

Inference can be performed in 3 ways: using cURL, or via the `InferenceClient` or `OpenAI` Python SDKs.

#### cURL

To send a POST request to the TEI endpoint using cURL, you can run the following command:

```bash
curl 127.0.0.1:8080/embed \
    -X POST \
    -d '{"inputs":"What is Deep Learning?"}' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

#### Python

To run inference using Python, you can either use the [`huggingface_hub`](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/en/index) Python SDK (recommended) or the `openai` Python SDK.

##### huggingface_hub

You can install it via pip as `pip install --upgrade --quiet huggingface_hub`, and then run:

```python
from huggingface_hub import InferenceClient

client = InferenceClient()

embedding = client.feature_extraction("What is deep learning?",
                                      model="http://localhost:8080/embed")
print(len(embedding[0]))
```

#### OpenAI

You can install it via pip as `pip install --upgrade openai`, and then run:

```python
import os
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(base_url="http://localhost:8080/v1/embeddings")

response = client.embeddings.create(
  model="tei",
  input="What is deep learning?"
)

print(response)
```

## Re-rankers and sequence classification

TEI also supports re-ranker and classic sequence classification models.

### Re-rankers

Rerankers, also called cross-encoders, are sequence classification models with a single class that score the similarity between a query and a text. See [this blogpost](https://blog.llamaindex.ai/boosting-rag-picking-the-best-embedding-reranker-models-42d079022e83) by
the LlamaIndex team to understand how you can use re-rankers models in your RAG pipeline to improve
downstream performance.

Let's say you want to use [`BAAI/bge-reranker-large`](https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-reranker-large). First, you can deploy it like so:

```shell
model=BAAI/bge-reranker-large
volume=$PWD/data

docker run --gpus all -p 8080:80 -v $volume:/data --pull always ghcr.io/huggingface/text-embeddings-inference:1.7 --model-id $model
```

Once you have deployed a model, you can use the `rerank` endpoint to rank the similarity between a query and a list of texts. With `cURL` this can be done like so:

```bash
curl 127.0.0.1:8080/rerank \
    -X POST \
    -d '{"query":"What is Deep Learning?", "texts": ["Deep Learning is not...", "Deep learning is..."], "raw_scores": false}' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

### Sequence classification models

You can also use classic Sequence Classification models like [`SamLowe/roberta-base-go_emotions`](https://huggingface.co/SamLowe/roberta-base-go_emotions):

```shell
model=SamLowe/roberta-base-go_emotions
volume=$PWD/data

docker run --gpus all -p 8080:80 -v $volume:/data --pull always ghcr.io/huggingface/text-embeddings-inference:1.7 --model-id $model
```

Once you have deployed the model you can use the `predict` endpoint to get the emotions most associated with an input:

```bash
curl 127.0.0.1:8080/predict \
    -X POST \
    -d '{"inputs":"I like you."}' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

## Batching

You can send multiple inputs in a batch. For example, for embeddings:

```bash
curl 127.0.0.1:8080/embed \
    -X POST \
    -d '{"inputs":["Today is a nice day", "I like you"]}' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

And for Sequence Classification:

```bash
curl 127.0.0.1:8080/predict \
    -X POST \
    -d '{"inputs":[["I like you."], ["I hate pineapples"]]}' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

## Air gapped deployment

To deploy Text Embeddings Inference in an air-gapped environment, first download the weights and then mount them inside
the container using a volume.

For example:

```shell
# (Optional) create a `models` directory
mkdir models
cd models

# Make sure you have git-lfs installed (https://git-lfs.com)
git lfs install
git clone https://huggingface.co/Alibaba-NLP/gte-base-en-v1.5

# Set the models directory as the volume path
volume=$PWD

# Mount the models directory inside the container with a volume and set the model ID
docker run --gpus all -p 8080:80 -v $volume:/data --pull always ghcr.io/huggingface/text-embeddings-inference:1.7 --model-id /data/gte-base-en-v1.5
```
