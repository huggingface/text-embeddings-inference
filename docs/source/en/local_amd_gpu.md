# Using TEI locally with an AMD GPU

Text-Embeddings-Inference supports the [AMD GPUs officially supporting ROCm](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/reference/system-requirements.html), including AMD Instinct MI210, MI250, MI300 and some of the AMD Radeon series GPUs.

To leverage AMD GPUs, Text-Embeddings-Inference relies on its Python backend, and not on the [candle](https://github.com/huggingface/candle) backend that is used for CPU, Nvidia GPUs and Metal. The support in the python backend is more limited (Bert embeddings) but easily extensible. We welcome contributions to extend the supported models.

## Usage through docker

Using docker is the recommended approach.

```bash
DOCKER_TAG=rocm-xxx # Specify the tag of the docker image to use
docker run --rm -it --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE --security-opt seccomp=unconfined --net host \
    --device=/dev/kfd --device=/dev/dri --group-add video --ipc=host --shm-size 32g \
    ghcr.io/huggingface/text-embeddings-inference:$DOCKER_TAG \
    --model-id sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2
```

and

```bash
curl 127.0.0.1:80/embed \
    -X POST -d '{"inputs":"What is Deep Learning?"}' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```
